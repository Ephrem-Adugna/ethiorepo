The Kingdom of Aksum (Ge'ez: መንግሥተ አክሱም), also known as the Kingdom of Axum or the Aksumite Empire, was an ancient
kingdom centered in Northern Ethiopia, and parts of what is now Eritrea.[2][3] Axumite rulers styled themselves as King
of kings, king of Aksum, Himyar, Raydan, Saba, Salhen, Tsiyamo, Beja and of Kush.[4] Ruled by the Aksumites, it existed
from approximately 80 BC to AD 825.[5] The polity was centered in the city of Axum and grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron

        <hr>
        The Kingdom of Aksum (Ge'ez: መንግሥተ አክሱም), also known as the Kingdom of Axum or the Aksumite Empire, was an
        ancient kingdom centered in Northern Ethiopia, and parts of what is now Eritrea.[2][3] Axumite rulers styled
        themselves as King of kings, king of Aksum, Himyar, Raydan, Saba, Salhen, Tsiyamo, Beja and of Kush.[4] Ruled by
        the Aksumites, it existed from approximately 80 BC to AD 825.[5] The polity was centered in the city of Axum and
        grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century
        AD. Aksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India. The Aksumite
        rulers facilitated trade by minting their own Aksumite currency, with the state establishing its hegemony over
        the declining Kingdom of Kush. It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula
        and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. The Manichaei
        prophet Mani (died 274 AD) regarded Axum as one of the four great powers of his time, the others being Persia,
        Rome and China.[2][6][7][8] It ruled the South Arabia of Yemen for half a century in the 6th century.

        The Aksumites erected monumental stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these
        granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, at 90 feet.[9] Under Ezana (fl. 320–360) Aksum
        adopted Christianity. [10][11]

        The kingdom's ancient capital, also called Axum, is now a town in Tigray Region (northern Ethiopia). The Kingdom
        used the name "Ethiopia" as early as the 4th century.[12][13] Tradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place
        of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the Queen of Sheba.[14]

          <h2>Zagwe</h2>
          <hr>
         The Zagwe dynasty (Ge'ez: ዛጔ ሥርወ መንግሥት) was a monarchical dynasty in Late Antiquity that ruled in present-day
         northern Ethiopia. After the historical name of the Lasta province.[1] Centered at Lalibela, it ruled large
         parts of the territory from approximately 900 to 1270, when the last Zagwe King Za-Ilmaknun was killed in
         battle by the forces of the Abyssinian King Yekuno Amlak. The name of the dynasty is thought to derive from the
         ancient Ge'ez phrase Ze-Agaw, meaning "opponent", in reference to the Mara Tekle Hymanote, the founder of the
         dynasty.[2] Zagwe's best-known King was Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, who is credited with having constructed the
         rock-hewn monolithic churches of Lalibela.

         David Buxton has stated that the area under the direct rule of the Zagwe kings "probably embraced the highlands
         of modern Eritrea and the whole of Tigray, extending southwards to Waag, Lasta and (Wollo province) and thence
         westwards towards Lake Tana (Begemder)."[3] Unlike the practice of later rulers of Ethiopia, Taddesse Tamrat
         argues that under the Zagwe dynasty the order of succession was that of brother succeeding brother as king,
         based on the Agaw laws of inheritance.

          <h2>Solomonic Period</h2>
          <hr>
       Around 1270, a new dynasty was established in the Abyssinian highlands under Yekuno Amlak, with aid from
       neighboring Makhzumi Dynasty deposed the last of the Zagwe kings and married one of his daughters.[42] According
       to legends, the new dynasty were male-line descendants of Aksumite monarchs, now recognized as the continuing
       Solomonic dynasty (the kingdom being thus restored to the biblical royal house). This legend was created to
       legitimize the Solomonic dynasty and was written down in the 14th century in the Kebra Negast, an account of the
       origins of the Solomonic dynasty.

       Under the Solomonic dynasty, the chief provinces became Tigray (northern), what is now Amhara (central) and Shewa
       (southern). The seat of government, or rather of overlordship, had usually been in Amhara or Shewa, the ruler of
       which, calling himself nəgusä nägäst, exacted tribute, when he could, from the other provinces. The title of
       nəgusä nägäst was to a considerable extent based on their alleged direct descent from Solomon and the queen of
       Sheba; but it is needless to say that in many, if not in most, cases their success was due more to the force of
       their arms than to the purity of their lineage. Under the early Solomonic dynasty Ethiopia engaged in military
       reforms and imperial expansion which left it dominating the Horn of Africa, especially under the rule of Amda
       Seyon I. There was also great artistic and literary advancement at this time, but also a decline in urbanisation
       as the Solomonic emperors didn't have any fixed capital, but rather moved around the empire in mobile camps.

       Under the early Solomonic dynasty monasticism grew strongly. The abbot Abba Ewostatewos created a new order
       called the Ewostathians who called for reforms in the church, including observance of the Sabbath, but was
       persecuted for his views and eventually forced into exile, eventually dying in Armenia. His zealous followers,
       also persecuted, formed isolated communities in Tigray. The movement grew strong enough that the emperor Dawit I,
       after first trying to crush the movement, legalized their observance of the Sabbath and proselytization of their
       faith. Finally under Zara Yaqob a compromise was made between the new Egyptian bishops and the Ewostathians at
       the Council of Mitmaq in 1450, restoring unity to the Ethiopian church.[43]

                       <hr>
                       Tewodros II (Ge'ez: ቴዎድሮስ, baptized as Sahle Dingil; 14 January 1818 – 14 April 1868) was the
                       Emperor of Ethiopia from 1855 until his death in 1868. He was born Kassa Hailegiorgis (Ge'ez: ካሳ
                       ኀይሉ; English: "restitution" and "His [or the] power"). He was described as a 'romantic
                       adventurer', a skillful and dauntless warrior, lion-like and an unselfish visionary. He had grown
                       up fighting Ottoman-Egyptian invaders and was a Robin hood figure; while a bandit or Shifta
                       against the tyrannical Royals, he would steal from the rich and give to the poor. His rule is
                       often placed as the beginning of modern Ethiopia and brought an end to the decentralized Zemene
                       Mesafint (Era of the Princes).

                       Tewodros II's origins were in the Era of the Princes, but his ambitions were not those of the
                       regional nobility. He sought to reestablish a cohesive Ethiopian state and to reform its
                       administration and church. He sought to restore Solomonic hegemony, and he considered himself the
                       Elect of God.

                       Tewodros II's first task after having reunited the other provinces was to bring Shewa under his
                       control. During the Era of the Princes, Shewa was, even more than most provinces, an independent
                       entity, its ruler even styling himself Negus (Neguece), the title for King. In the course of
                       subduing the Shewans, Tewodros took with him a Shewan prince, Menelik II which he brought as his
                       own son, who would later become Emperor or [Atse] himself. Despite his success against Shewa,
                       Tewodros faced constant rebellions by stiffnecked Nobles in other regions not understanding the
                       benefits of modernization.[1][2] He ultimately committed suicide at the Battle of Magdala, during
                       the British Expedition to Abyssinia.

                       In the first six years of his reign, the new ruler managed to put down these rebellions, and the
                       empire was relatively peaceful from about 1861 to 1863, but the energy, wealth, and manpower
                       necessary to deal with regional opposition limited the scope of Tewodros's other activities.
                       Tewodros II never realized his dream of restoring a strong monarchy, although he took many
                       important initial steps. He sought to establish the principle that governors and judges must be
                       salaried appointees. He also established a professional standing army, rather than depending on
                       local lords to provide soldiers for his expeditions. He introduced the collection of books in the
                       form of a library, tax codes, as well as a centralized political system with respective
                       administrative districts.[3] He also intended to reform the church but he was confronted by
                       strong opposition when he tried to impose a tax on church lands to help finance government
                       activities. His confiscation of these lands gained him enemies in the church and little support
                       elsewhere. Essentially, Tewodros was a talented military campaigner.[4][5]

                      Italian East Africa (Italian: Africa Orientale Italiana, AOI)[3] was an Italian colony in the Horn
                      of Africa. It was formed in 1936 through the merger of Italian Somalia, Italian Eritrea, and the
                      newly occupied Ethiopian Empire, conquered in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.[4]

                      Italian East Africa was divided into six governorates. Eritrea and Somalia, Italian possessions
                      since the 1880s, were enlarged with captured Ethiopian territory and became the Eritrea and
                      Somalia Governorates. The remainder of "Italian Ethiopia" consisted the Harar, Galla-Sidamo,
                      Amhara, and Scioa Governorates. Fascist colonial policy had a divide and conquer characteristic
                      and favored the Somali and Tigrayan peoples in order to weaken the Amhara people who had been the
                      ruling ethnic group in the Ethiopian Empire.

                      During the Second World War, Italian East Africa was occupied by a British-led force including
                      colonial units and Ethiopian guerrillas in November 1941.[5] After the war, Italian Somalia and
                      Eritrea came under British administration, while Ethiopia regained its independence. In 1950,
                      occupied Somalia became the United Nations Trust Territory of Somaliland, administered by Italy
                      from 1950 until its independence in 1960. Occupied Eritrea became an autonomous part of Ethiopia
                      in 1952.

                          Selassie attempted to modernize the country through a series of political and social reforms,
                          including the introduction of Ethiopia's first written constitution and the abolition of
                          slavery. He led the failed efforts to defend Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War
                          and spent the period of Italian occupation in exile in England. He returned to lead Ethiopia
                          in 1941 after the British Empire defeated the Italian occupiers in the East African campaign.
                          He dissolved the Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea, which was established by the UN General
                          Assembly in 1950, and integrated Eritrea as a province of Ethiopia while fighting to prevent
                          their independence.

                          His internationalist views led to Ethiopia becoming a charter member of the United Nations.[7]
                          In 1963, he presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity, the precursor of
                          the African Union, and served as its first chairman. He was overthrown in a 1974 military coup
                          by a Marxist-Leninist junta, the Derg. Selassie was murdered by the junta on 27 August 1975.

                          Among some members of the Rastafari movement, Haile Selassie is referred to as the returned
                          messiah of the Bible, God incarnate. This distinction notwithstanding, Haile Selassie was a
                          Christian and adhered to the tenets and liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox church.[8][9] The
                          Rastafari movement was founded in Jamaica in the 1930s and its followers are estimated at
                          between 700,000 and one million.

                          He has been criticized by some historians for his suppression of rebellions among the landed
                          aristocracy (the mesafint), which consistently opposed his reforms; some critics have also
                          criticized Ethiopia's failure to modernize rapidly enough.[10][11] During his rule the Harari
                          people were persecuted and many left the Harari Region.[12] His regime was also criticized by
                          human rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch, as autocratic and illiberal.[11][13] Under
                          Haile Selassie Regime Oromo was banned from education, and use in
                          administration[14][15][16]The Amhara culture dominated throughout the eras of military and
                          monarchic rule. Both the Haile Selassie and the Derg government relocated numerous Amharas
                          into southern Ethiopia where they served in government administration, courts, church and even
                          in school, where Oromo texts were eliminated and replaced by Amharic.[17][18][19] The
                          Abyssinian elites perceived the various southern minority languages as hindrances to Ethiopian
                          national identity expansion.[20] Following the death of Hachalu Hundessa in June 2020, the
                          Statue of Haile Selassie in Wimbledon Park, London was destroyed by Oromo protesters, and his
                          father's equestrian monument in Harar was removed.

                              <h2> Derg Period</h2>
                              <hr>
                             The Derg (also spelled Dergue; from Ge'ez: ደርግ, "committee" or "council"; Oromo: Dergii),
                             officially the Provisional Military Government of Ethiopia, was the military junta that
                             ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1987, when the military leadership formally civilianized the
                             administration but stayed in power until 1991.

                             The Derg was established in June 1974 as the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces,
                             Police and Territorial Army, by officers of the Ethiopian Army and police led initially by
                             Chairman Aman Andom. The Derg was formally renamed the Provisional Military Administrative
                             Council and in September 1974 overthrew the government of the Ethiopian Empire and Emperor
                             Haile Selassie during mass protests. The Derg abolished the monarchy and established
                             Ethiopia as a Marxist-Leninist one-party state with itself as the vanguard party in a
                             provisional government. The abolition of feudalism, increased literacy, nationalization,
                             and sweeping land reform including the resettlement and villagization from the Ethiopian
                             Highlands became priorities. Mengistu Haile Mariam became Chairman in 1977, launching the
                             Red Terror political repression campaign (Qey Shibir) to eliminate political opponents,
                             with tens of thousands imprisoned and executed without trial.[4]

                             By the mid-1980s, Ethiopia was ravaged by multiple issues, such as recovering from invasion
                             attempt by neighbouring Somalia, droughts, economic decline and the 1983–1985 famine. (The
                             Derg itself estimated more than a million deaths from famine during its time in power.[5])
                             This was followed by increasing reliance on foreign aid and a gradual resurgence of
                             conflicts, particularly the Eritrean War of Independence, and the Ethiopian Civil War
                             between it and various ethnic militias in the periphery. In 1987, Mengistu abolished the
                             Derg and formed the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia led by the Workers' Party of
                             Ethiopia, with a new government containing civilians but still dominated by surviving
                             members of the Derg.[6]Both the Haile Selassie and the Derg government relocated numerous
                             Amharas into southern Ethiopia where they served in government administration, courts,
                             church and even in school, where Oromo texts were eliminated and replaced by
                             Amharic.[7][8][9] The Abyssinian elites perceived the various southern minority languages
                             as hindrances to Ethiopian national identity expansion.[10]
